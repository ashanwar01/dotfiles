# dotfiles

This is my scuffed dotfiles, I'm not the best at configuring but I will keep tinkering :) <br>
Feel free to try out my configs! <br>

## Dependencies

### Neovim

- npm for lsp config in Lazyvim to function properly

### Tmux

- You'll have to set up tpm manually, as I haven't written a script for it yet (script coming soon !)
